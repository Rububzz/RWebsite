          Hey yo its me your dinopuppykittie boyfriend
          <br /> This website was made quite a while back, or more of started
          way awhile back,
          <br /> and I am kinda a noob so it kinda be bad so me sorry I tried
          hahahah.
          <br /> I am hoping to improve my coding so maybe in the future I can
          actually code something
          <br /> actually half decent that could maybe surprise you hehe.
          <br /> It&#39;s already our 2nd birthday we spent together and I
          can&#39;t believe it&#39;s already
          <br /> been 1 and a half years with you. It&#39;s really been an
          amazing time and I hope
          <br /> that we can have even more great times. I am sorta writing this
          before the final code even finishes
          <br /> so idk when imma give this to you (in Korea/Japan or in SG).
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          What else can I say that hasn&#39;t already been said before
          <br />
          The words &quot;I love you&quot; aren&#39;t even enough to capture the
          feelings I have for you
          <br />
          You make me want to become a better person and boyfriend for you haha
          <br />
          Our second birthday spent together! Even though we weren&#39;t able to
          celebrate it together on the day itself,
          <br />
          I still easily felt the love you had for me from how sad you were when
          you couldn&#39;t spend it with me
          <br />
          <br />
          There are so many words for me to say to you to show the level of love
          I have for you
          <br />
          Instead, I will show you the love you deserve for however long you can
          tolerate me haha
          <br />
          I love you soooooo much and happy birthday to my one and only
          <br />
        </p>
