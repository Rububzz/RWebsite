          Hey yo its me your dinopuppykittie boyfriend
          <br /> This website was made quite a while back, or more of started
          way awhile back,
          <br /> and i am kinda a noob so it kinda be bad so me sorry i tried
          hahahah.
          <br /> I am hoping to improve my coding so maybe in the future i can
          actually code something
          <br /> actually half decent that could maybe surprise you hehe.
          <br /> Its already our 2nd birthday we spent together and i cant
          believe its already
          <br /> been 1 and a half years with you. Its really been an amazing
          time and i hope
          <br /> that we can have even more great times. I am sorta writing this
          before the final code even finishes
          <br /> so idk when imma give this to you(in korea/jpn or in SG).
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          What else can i say that hasnt already been said before
          <br />
          The words i love you arent even enough to capture the feelings i have
          for you
          <br />
          You make me want to become a better person and boyfriend for you haha
          <br />
          Our Second Birthday spent together!Even though we weren't able to
          celebrate it together on the day itself,
          <br />
          I still easily felt the love you had for me from how sad you were when
          you couldnt spend it with me
          <br />
          There are so many words for me to say to u to show the level of love I
          have for you
          <br />
          Instead I will show you the love you deserve for however long you can
          tolerate me haha
          <br />
          I love you soooooo much
          <br />
          AND HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYYYYYYYY WOOOOOOOO!I LOVE YOU SOOOO MUCHHHHHH WOOOO
